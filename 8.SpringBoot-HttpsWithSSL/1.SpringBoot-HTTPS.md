#	Spring Boot SSL [https]

-	Configure web application to run on SSL (HTTPS) with self-signed certificate

##	Terminology

###	SSL:

-	stands for Secure Sockets Layer
-	It is the industry standard protocol for keeping an internet connection secure by safeguarding all sensitive data that is being sent between two systems, preventing hackers from reading and modifying any information transferred


###	TLS:

-	(Transport Layer Security) is an updated, more secure, version of SSL
-	It adds more features
-	Today, certificates provided by certificate authorities are based on TLS only
-	But regarding secured communication over network, the term SSL is still common as it is the old and just become popular among community


###	HTTPS:

-	(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure) appears in the URL when a website is secured by an SSL certificate
-	 It is the secured version of HTTP protocol

###	Truststore and Keystore 

-	Those are used to store SSL certificates in Java but there is little difference between them
-	truststore is used to store public certificates while keystore is used to store private certificates of client or server

-------------------------------

##	Create our own self signed SSL certificate

-	To get SSL digital certificate for our application we have two options –

	-	to create a self-signed certificate
	-	to obtain SSL certificate from certification authority(CA) we call it CA certificate
	
-	To generate  self-signed certificate, we will use keytool command
-	We need to run the keytool -genkey command from command prompt


		keytool -genkey -alias selfsigned_localhost_sslserver -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 700 -keypass changeit -storepass changeit -keystore ssl-server.jks
			
	-	-genkey – is the keytool command to generate the certificate, actually keytool is a multipurpose and robust tool which has several options
	-	-alias selfsigned_localhost_sslserver – indicates the alias of the certificate, which is used by SSL/TLS layer
	-	-keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 700 – are self descriptive parameters indicating the crypto algorithm, keysize and certificate validity.
	-	-keypass changeit -storepass changeit – are the passwords of our truststore and keystore
	-	-keystore ssl-server.jks – is the actual keystore where the certificate and public/private key will be stored. Here we are using JKS fromat – Java Key Store, there are other formats as well for keystore.
			
-	That’s all we need at this point regarding certification generation
-	This will generate the ssl-server.jks keystore file containing our self signed certificates in the directory from where keytool command has been executed

-------------------------------

##	Create Spring-boot project and configure SSL

		server.port=8443
		server.ssl.key-alias=selfsigned_localhost_sslserver
		server.ssl.key-password=changeit
		server.ssl.key-store=classpath:ssl-server.jks
		server.ssl.key-store-provider=SUN
		server.ssl.key-store-type=JKS
		
		
-	That’s all we need to enable https. It’s pretty easy, right? Thanks to spring boot for making everything possible very easily


##	Redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS
		
-	This is an optional step in case you want to redirect your HTTP traffic to HTTPS, 
-	so that the full site becomes secured. To do that in spring boot, we need to add HTTP connector at 8080 port and then we need to set redirect port 8443. So that any request in 8080 through http, 
-	it would be automatically redirected to 8443 and https
		
		private Connector redirectConnector() {
		  Connector connector = new Connector("org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol");
		  connector.setScheme("http");
		  connector.setPort(8080);
		  connector.setSecure(false);
		  connector.setRedirectPort(8443);
		   
		  return connector;
		}
