#	Key Components and Internals of Spring Boot Framework

-	Spring Boot Framework has mainly four major Components.

	-	Spring Boot Starters
	-	Spring Boot AutoConfigurator
	-	Spring Boot CLI
	-	Spring Boot Actuator
	
	
##	Spring Boot Starter

-	The main responsibility of Spring Boot Starter is to combine a group of common or related dependencies into single dependencies
-	Spring Boot Starter component combines all related jars into single jar file so that we can add only jar file dependency to our build files. Instead of adding above 4 jars files to our build file, we need to add one and only one jar file: “spring-boot-starter-web” jar file
-	When we add “spring-boot-starter-web” jar file dependency to our build file, then Spring Boot Framework will automatically download all required jars and add to our project classpath.

-	Major Advantages of Spring Boot Starter

	-	Spring Boot Starter reduces defining many dependencies simplify project build dependencies.
	-	Spring Boot Starter simplifies project build dependencies.
	
	
##	Spring Boot AutoConfigurator

-	To develop a Spring-based application requires lot of configuration (Either XML Configuration of Annotation Configuration). Then how to solve this problem.
-	The solution to this problem is Spring Boot AutoConfigurator. 
-	The main responsibility of Spring Boot AutoConfigurator is to reduce the Spring Configuration
-	If we use “spring-boot-starter-web” jar file in our project build file, then Spring Boot AutoConfigurator will resolve views, view resolvers etc. automatically.

##	Spring Boot CLI

-	Spring Boot CLI(Command Line Interface) is a Spring Boot software to run and test Spring Boot applications from command prompt.
- 	When we run Spring Boot applications using CLI, then it internally uses Spring Boot Starter and Spring Boot AutoConfigurate components to resolve all dependencies and execute the application.


##	Spring Boot Actuator

-	Spring Boot Actuator components gives many features, but two major features are

	-	Providing Management EndPoints to Spring Boot Applications.
	-	Spring Boot Applications Metrics.
