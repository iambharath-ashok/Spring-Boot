#	Spring Boot MVC Application

-	In order make Spring Boot Application as MVC with views like JSPs

	- 	Create a folder called webapps 
	-	Under webapps create WEB-INF folder
	-	Create a view folder   called jsp
	-	place the views in this folder
	

## SpringBoot View Resolver

-	SpringBoot by default will not able to map logical view name with actual view
-	SpringBoot will redirect to default error handler view
-	In order to map view name to actual view, we need to add view resolver properties in the application properties file


		spring.mvc.view.prefix=/WEB-INF/jsp
		spring.mvc.view.suffix=.jsp


-	Add tomcat-embed-jasper dependency if its still not working
