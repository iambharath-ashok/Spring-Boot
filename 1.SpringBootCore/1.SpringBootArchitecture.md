# Spring Boot 


##	Spring Boot Initializer 

-	Its a utility created by Pivotal to create spring boot application with proper dependencies


##	Spring Boot pom.xml

-	Parent in Spring Boot pom.xml is similar to inheritance in java
-	Parent brings lots of magic in to application 
-	It tell the base version of dependencies
-	Spring Boot dependencies will always start from groupId as org.springframework.boot
-	Spring Boot bring all the required transitive dependencies in to project



##	@SpirngBootApplication annotation

-	@SpringBootApplication does two things
	-	Initializes Component Scan i.e Initializes Spring Framework
	-	Initializes SpringBoot itself or Auto Configuration
	
	
	
	
## Application.properties file

-	application.properties file is configuration file
-	We can add all the spring boot specific properties and also application specific properties in the application.properties file




## Spring Boot Starter Parent

-	Spring Boot Starter Parent uses interitance concept
-	We will use Spring Boot parent in pom.xml and SpringBoot Parent pom will have another parent called spring-boot-dependencies
-	Spring-boot-dependencies will have versions of all the dependencies that we are using in spring boot
-	SpringBoot dependencies is the parent of spring boot starter parent that defines all the version of dependencies
-	SpringBoot Starter parent specifies the version of dependencies 

	-	plugins 
	-	java version
	-	and much more things


##	SpringBoot Starter Web

-	provides all the dependencies that needs to run as web application
-	Spring Boot Starter Web brings dependencies like jackson, hibernate-validator, spring-web, spring-webmvc, embedded tomcat


## Embedded Tomcat

-	We are including tomcat inside the application that why its called embedded server
-	Suppose now i want to run my application on Linux Server 
-	I dont need to install tomcat on the linux server
-	I can directly the run the application using embedded tomcat server as tomcat is directly provided by our application


##	Dev Tools

-	Dev tools is an advantage at development mode and improves developers productivity
-	It will reload the changes quickly and restart the server
-	Dev tools keeps monitoring the resources folders  and restart the server quickly
-	No need to restart the server again and again for the changes
-	Not work for maven changes

# Spring Boot Auto Configuration

-	Spring Boot Auto Configuration does auto configuration for most of the things depending on the dependencies available on classpath
-	Spring Boot Shows What are the things that are automatically configured and what are not
-	HAL Browser also shows the things that are configured automatically at /autoconfig endpoint

## Spring Boot Auto Config Jar 

-	Spring Boot Auto Config jar will handle the auto-configuration for the applications
-	There are lot of auto-configuration classes available in this jar which will handle the auto-configuration



#	@SpringBootApplication Annotation

-	It used to Bootstrap and launch a Spring application from a Java main() method
	-	Create an instance of Spring’s ApplicationContext.
	-	Enable the functionality to accept command-line arguments and expose them as Spring properties.
	-	Load all the Spring beans as per the configuration
	
	
##	@SpringBootApplication Annotation

-	This annotation is a shortcut of applying 3 annotations in one statement –

	-	@SpringBootConfiguration
	-	@EnableAutoConfiguration
	-	@ComponentScan



#	Spring-boot-starter Maven Templates

-	Spring Boot starters are templates that contain a collection of all the relevant transitive dependencies that are needed to start a particular functionality
-	Each starter has a special file, which contains the list of all the provided dependencies Spring provides


##	Popular templates and their transitive dependencies

-	These files can be found inside /resources/META-INF folder of template project and file name is spring.provides

##	Spring Boot Devtools


-	Automatically reload the changes and restart the server with changes 
-	Helpful while working with UI
