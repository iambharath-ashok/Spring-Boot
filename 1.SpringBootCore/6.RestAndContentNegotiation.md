##	What is REST?
-	Architectural style for the web. REST specifies a set of constraints.
	-	Client - Server : Server (service provider) should be different from a client (service consumer).
	-	Enables loose coupling and independent evolution of server and client as new technologies emerge.
	-	Each service should be stateless.
	-	Each Resource has a resource identifier.
	-	It should be possible to cache response.
	-	A resource can have multiple representations. Resource can modified through a message in any of the these representations.

-	PATCH - Update part of a resource
